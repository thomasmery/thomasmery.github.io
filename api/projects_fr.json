Il m'a permis de réaliser une application en utilisant uniquement Javascript et de mieux comprendre des concepts de programmation fonctionnel que je connaissais peu et que j'ai vraiment aimé.\n\nJ'ai aussi apprécié de pouvoir apprendre et utiliser les concepts de temps-réel propre à Meteor et d'approcher de plus près le monde de [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) et [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). \n\nLe développement de l'application s'est déroulé à un moment où Meteor évoluait rapidement et même s'il était parfois difficile de suivre cette évolution sur un projet solo comme celui-là cela m'a poussé à toujours en apprendre davantage pour permettre au projet de voir le jour dans de bonnes conditions.\n\nJ'ai aussi eu la possibilité d'utiliser la librairie [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) React qui m'a aidé aussi bien en terme de rendu professionnel que de rapidité de réalisation.\n\n_L'accès à ce projet (application et code) sont privés mais peuvent être obtenus sur demande pour évaluation / recrutement_",

As I was getting more familiar with the _React Virtualized_ library and got to develop a custom solution for a specific requirement of the app I took a little time to package this solution for the community: [react-virtualized-with-drawer](https://github.com/thomasmery/react-virtualized-with-drawer) - a _React Function as Child Component_ to decorate a react-virtualized List/Table with Drawer capability.\n\nThis project also allowed me to start using the Jest Javascript testing framework along with the Enzyme testing suite for React.\n\n_Access to this project's code is private but can be obtained for review / hire purposes._",

It attempts to follow good practices and, for instance, is thoroughly tested with [PHP Unit](https://phpunit.de/), the [WordPress testing suite](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/plugin-unit-tests/) and the [WP-CLI project](http://wp-cli.org/).\n\nThis extension makes use of the [Php Discogs API](https://github.com/ricbra/php-discogs-api) project based on the [Guzzle PHP HTTP client](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle). It fetches infos from the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/) as well as the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) \n\nThe extension should, in the future, build on its primary goals (helping with managing records informations) but also help store owners publish the record they sell within their e-commerce site on other platforms at the same time.",
