I was really glad to be able to use only Javascript and to get to approach functional programming concepts that I came to really like.####\n\nI was really seduced by _Meteor real-time reactivity_ concept and even though it posed specific challenges I had to take my skills to another level, also approaching more closely the world of [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) and the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ecosystem.\n\nThe development of the application took place at a time where Meteor was moving very quickly, and even though it could be hard at times to follow the rapid pace, it forced me to take in a lot of information in a short time thus enhancing my ability to be ... reactive and responsive to changes.\n\nI also had the opportunity to use the [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) React library that helped me in giving the application a clean and professional look as well as speeding up parts of the development process.\n\n_Access to this project's code is private but can be obtained for review / hire purposes._",

It attempts to follow good practices and, for instance, is thoroughly tested with [PHP Unit](https://phpunit.de/), the [WordPress testing suite](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/plugin-unit-tests/) and the [WP-CLI project](http://wp-cli.org/).\n\nThis extension makes use of the [Php Discogs API](https://github.com/ricbra/php-discogs-api) project based on the [Guzzle PHP HTTP client](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle). It fetches infos from the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/) as well as the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). \n\nThe extension should, in the future, build on its primary goals (helping with managing records informations) but also help store owners publish the record they sell within their e-commerce site on other platforms at the same time.",
